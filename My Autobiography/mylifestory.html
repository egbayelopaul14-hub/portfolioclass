  <h1 style="color:navy;">My Life, My Story</h1>
        <p style="color:red;"><strong>By: Egbayelo Paul Ayomide </strong></p>
        <h1 style="font-size: 300%;">1. Introduction </h1>
        <p style="font-family:courier;">My name is Egbayelo Paul Ayomide. I was born on the 14th of October, 2008, in Agric, Ojo, Lagos State, Nigeria. I am 16 years old and currently a 200 level student of the Bells University of Technology. I come from the Yoruba ethnic group, and I am a Christian. I come from a family of seven- my parents, three brothers, one sister, and me. This is just a little about who I am.</p>

        <h1 style="text-align:center;">2. Early Childhood</h1>
        <p style="font-size: 160%;">I spent most of my childhood in Ogun state. Despite being born in Lagos, My family moved to Ogun State when i was still little. My early childhood was pretty quiet. I wasn't the type of child that played outside a lot or had many friends. Most times, i was either watching TV indoors or doing random things.</p>
        <p>I started school at a private school, and never attended a public school throughout my primary and tertiary education. I didn't talk much in class, and I usually kept to myself, but i was good in school, and that was one of  my key strengths. I was more focused in class and set on keeping myself out of trouble.</p>
        <h1>3. Education </h1>
        <p><i>I've attended a lot of schools since i started, some of which are; Yetty School, Majob School, Mindbuilders and Care International school, Padema School, Padema College, Blazing Glory Academy, Prime Touch College and I'm currently studying in bells University of Technology Ota.</i></p>
        <h1>Hobbies and Interests</h1>
        <p>When I'm not doing schoolwork, I play the keyboard. I'm a big fan of music, I love learning and playing musical instruments. I started my musical Journey about three and a half years ago, I took the bold step of learning the keyboard all by myself, although I had some help from my very good friend Sommy dan. He taught me the basics, then we continued learning and growing together till i left Blazing Glory Academy. Playing the keyboard is my most valuable asset as of today</p>
        <h1>Dreams And Goals</h1>
        <P>I have always loved cars, I can literally look at cars from morning till night and not get tired. So i chose the closest i could get to the Automobile Industry by studying Mechanical Engineering, Although i wanted to study Automobile Engineering, the schools close to me don't offer it, so i had to choose the closest to it. I plan to major in Automotive engineering after I'm done with my first degree. </P>
